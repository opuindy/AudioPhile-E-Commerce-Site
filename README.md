**The inspiration for this project comes from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)**

## Overview
This is a solution to the [Audiophile e-commerce website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
    .Shipping always adds $50 to the order
    .VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- useRuducer and Context Api For State Management
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I got more comfortable using reducer and context Api for state management as well as improve my styled components usage.
It was my first time working on how to validate forms and it was nice learning how to use javascript for custom form validation.  



### Continued development
- I would learn to use Redux for state management and apply it in subsequent projects. 
- I will also love to have suggestions and directions on different approaches to improve my code .
